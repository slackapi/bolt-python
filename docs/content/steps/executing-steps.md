Workflow Steps from Apps are a deprecated feature.

Workflow Steps from Apps are different than, and not interchangable with, Slack automation workflows. We encourage those who are currently publishing Workflow Steps from Apps to consider the new [Slack automation features](https://api.slack.com/automation), such as custom functions for Bolt.

Please [read the Slack API changelog entry](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2023-08-workflow-steps-from-apps-step-back) for more information.

:::

When your workflow step is executed by an end user, your app will receive a [`workflow_step_execute` event](https://api.slack.com/events/workflow_step_execute). The `execute` callback in your `WorkflowStep` configuration will be run when this event is received.

Using the `inputs` from the `save` callback, this is where you can make third-party API calls, save information to a database, update the user's Home tab, or decide the outputs that will be available to subsequent workflow steps by mapping values to the `outputs` object.

Within the `execute` callback, your app must either call `complete()` to indicate that the step's execution was successful, or `fail()` to indicate that the step's execution failed.

Refer to the module documents (<a href="https://slack.dev/bolt-python/api-docs/slack_bolt/kwargs_injection/args.html">common</a> / <a href="https://slack.dev/bolt-python/api-docs/slack_bolt/workflows/step/utilities/index.html">step-specific</a>) to learn the available arguments.
```python
def execute(step, complete, fail):
    inputs = step["inputs"]
    # if everything was successful
    outputs = {
        "task_name": inputs["task_name"]["value"],
        "task_description": inputs["task_description"]["value"],
    }
    complete(outputs=outputs)

    # if something went wrong
    error = {"message": "Just testing step failure!"}
    fail(error=error)

ws = WorkflowStep(
    callback_id="add_task",
    edit=edit,
    save=save,
    execute=execute,
)
app.step(ws)
```
