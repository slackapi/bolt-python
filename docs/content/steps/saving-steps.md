Workflow Steps from Apps are a deprecated feature.

Workflow Steps from Apps are different than, and not interchangable with, Slack automation workflows. We encourage those who are currently publishing Workflow Steps from Apps to consider the new [Slack automation features](https://api.slack.com/automation), such as custom functions for Bolt.

Please [read the Slack API changelog entry](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2023-08-workflow-steps-from-apps-step-back) for more information.

:::

After the configuration modal is opened, your app will listen for the `view_submission` event. The `save` callback in your `WorkflowStep` configuration will be run when this event is received.

Within the `save` callback, the `update()` method can be used to save the builder's step configuration by passing in the following arguments:

- `inputs` is a dictionary representing the data your app expects to receive from the user upon workflow step execution.
- `outputs` is a list of objects containing data that your app will provide upon the workflow step's completion. Outputs can then be used in subsequent steps of the workflow.
- `step_name` overrides the default Step name
- `step_image_url` overrides the default Step image

To learn more about how to structure these parameters, [read the documentation](https://api.slack.com/reference/workflows/workflow_step).

Refer to the module documents (<a href="https://slack.dev/bolt-python/api-docs/slack_bolt/kwargs_injection/args.html">common</a> / <a href="https://slack.dev/bolt-python/api-docs/slack_bolt/workflows/step/utilities/index.html">step-specific</a>) to learn the available arguments.
```python
def save(ack, view, update):
    ack()

    values = view["state"]["values"]
    task_name = values["task_name_input"]["name"]
    task_description = values["task_description_input"]["description"]
                
    inputs = {
        "task_name": {"value": task_name["value"]},
        "task_description": {"value": task_description["value"]}
    }
    outputs = [
        {
            "type": "text",
            "name": "task_name",
            "label": "Task name",
        },
        {
            "type": "text",
            "name": "task_description",
            "label": "Task description",
        }
    ]
    update(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

ws = WorkflowStep(
    callback_id="add_task",
    edit=edit,
    save=save,
    execute=execute,
)
app.step(ws)
