Steps from apps are a deprecated feature.

Steps from apps are different than, and not interchangeable with, Slack automation workflows. We encourage those who are currently publishing steps from apps to consider the new [Slack automation features](https://api.slack.com/automation), such as custom steps for Bolt.

Please [read the Slack API changelog entry](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2023-08-workflow-steps-from-apps-step-back) for more information.

:::

When a builder adds (or later edits) your step in their workflow, your app will receive a [`workflow_step_edit` event](https://api.slack.com/reference/workflows/workflow_step_edit). The `edit` callback in your `WorkflowStep` configuration will be run when this event is received.

Whether a builder is adding or editing a step, you need to send them a [step from app configuration modal](https://api.slack.com/reference/workflows/configuration-view). This modal is where step-specific settings are chosen, and it has more restrictions than typical modalsâ€”most notably, it cannot include `title`, `submit`, or `close` properties. By default, the configuration modal's `callback_id` will be the same as the step from app.

Within the `edit` callback, the `configure()` utility can be used to easily open your step's configuration modal by passing in the view's blocks with the corresponding `blocks` argument. To disable saving the configuration before certain conditions are met, you can also pass in `submit_disabled` with a value of `True`.

To learn more about opening configuration modals, [read the documentation](https://api.slack.com/workflows/steps#handle_config_view).

Refer to the module documents (<a href="https://slack.dev/bolt-python/api-docs/slack_bolt/kwargs_injection/args.html">common</a> / <a href="https://slack.dev/bolt-python/api-docs/slack_bolt/workflows/step/utilities/index.html">step-specific</a>) to learn the available arguments.

```python
def edit(ack, step, configure):
    ack()

    blocks = [
        {
            "type": "input",
            "block_id": "task_name_input",
            "element": {
                "type": "plain_text_input",
                "action_id": "name",
                "placeholder": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "Add a task name"},
            },
            "label": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "Task name"},
        },
        {
            "type": "input",
            "block_id": "task_description_input",
            "element": {
                "type": "plain_text_input",
                "action_id": "description",
                "placeholder": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "Add a task description"},
            },
            "label": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "Task description"},
        },
    ]
    configure(blocks=blocks)

ws = WorkflowStep(
    callback_id="add_task",
    edit=edit,
    save=save,
    execute=execute,
)
app.step(ws)
```
