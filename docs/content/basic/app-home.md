title: Publishing views to App Home
lang: en
slug: /concepts/app-home
---

<a href="https://api.slack.com/surfaces/tabs/using">Home tabs</a> are customizable surfaces accessible via the sidebar and search that allow apps to display views on a per-user basis. After enabling App Home within your app configuration, home tabs can be published and updated by passing a `user_id` and <a href="https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/views">view payload</a> to the <a href="https://api.slack.com/methods/views.publish">`views.publish`</a> method.

You can subscribe to the <a href="https://api.slack.com/events/app_home_opened">`app_home_opened`</a> event to listen for when users open your App Home.

Refer to [the module document](https://slack.dev/bolt-python/api-docs/slack_bolt/kwargs_injection/args.html) to learn the available listener arguments.
```python

            # Use the user ID associated with the event
            user_id=event["user"],
            # Home tabs must be enabled in your app configuration
