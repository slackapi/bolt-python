# Modals

If you're learning about Slack apps, modals, or slash commands for the first time, you've come to the right place! In this tutorial, we'll take a look at setting up your very own server using Glitch, and using that server to run your Slack app. 

Let's take a look at the technologies we'll use in this tutorial:

* Glitch is a online IDE that allows you to collaboratively work on code and host your own server. Glitch should only be used for development purposes and should not be used in production.
* We'll use Python in conjunction with our [Bolt for Python](https://github.com/SlackAPI/bolt-python) SDK.
* [Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit/building) is a UI framework for Slack apps that allows you to create beautiful, interactive messages within Slack. If you've ever seen a message in Slack with buttons or a select menu, that's Block Kit.
* Modals are similar to a pop-up window that displays right in Slack. They grab the attention of the user, and are normally used to prompt users to provide some kind of information or input.

## The process {#steps}

1. [Create a new app](https://api.slack.com/apps/new) and name it whatever you like.

2. [Remix (or clone)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/intro-to-modals-bolt) the Glitch template.

Here's a copy of what the modal payload looks like &mdash; this is what powers the modal.

```json
{
  "type": "modal",
  "callback_id": "gratitude-modal",
  "title": {
    "type": "plain_text",
    "text": "Gratitude Box",
    "emoji": true
  },
  "submit": {
    "type": "plain_text",
    "text": "Submit",
    "emoji": true
  },
  "close": {
    "type": "plain_text",
    "text": "Cancel",
    "emoji": true
  },
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "input",
      "block_id": "my_block",
      "element": {
        "type": "plain_text_input",
        "action_id": "my_action"
      },
      "label": {
        "type": "plain_text",
        "text": "Say something nice!",
        "emoji": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Find the base path to your server by clicking **Share**, then copy the Live site link.

4. On your app page, navigate to **Interactivity & Shortcuts**. Append "/slack/events" to your base path URL and enter it into the **Request URL** e.g., `https://festive-harmonious-march.glitch.me/slack/events`.  This allows your server to retrieve information from the modal. You can see the code for this within the Glitch project.

5. Create the slash command so you can access it within Slack. Navigate to the **Slash Commands** section and create a new command. Note the **Request URL** is the same link as above, e.g. `https://festive-harmonious-march.glitch.me/slack/events` . The code that powers the slash command and opens a modal can be found within the Glitch project.

6. Select **Install App**. After you've done this, you'll see a **Bot User OAuth Access Token**, copy this.

7. Navigate to your Glitch project and click the `.env` file where the credentials are stored, and paste your bot token where the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` variable is shown. This allows your server to send authenticated requests to the Slack API. You'll also need to head to your app's settings page under **Basic Information** and copy the _Signing secret_ to place into the `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` variable.

8. Test by heading to Slack and typing `/thankyou`.

All done! ðŸŽ‰ You've created your first slash command using Block Kit and modals! The world is your oyster; you can create more complex modals by playing around with [Block Kit Builder](https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder).

### Extra credit {#extra_credit}

For a little extra credit, let's post the feedback we received in a channel.

1. Add the `chat:write` bot scope, which allows your bot to post messages within Slack. You can do this in the **OAuth & Permissions** section for your Slack app.  
2. Reinstall your app to apply the scope.
3. Create a channel and name it `#thanks`.  Get its ID by right clicking the channel name, copying the link, and copying the last part starting with the letter `C`. For example, if your channel link looks like this: https://my.slack.com/archives/C123FCN2MLM, the ID is `C123FCN2MLM`. 
4. Add your bot to the channel by typing the command `/invite @your_bots_name`.
5. Uncomment the `Extra Credit` code within your Glitch project and make sure to replace `your_channel_id` with the ID above.
6. Test it out by typing `/thankyou`, and watching all the feedback come into your channel!
