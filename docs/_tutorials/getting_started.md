# Getting started with Bolt for Python

<div class="section-content">
This guide is meant to walk you through getting up and running with a Slack app using Bolt for Python. Along the way, weâ€™ll create a new Slack app, set up your local environment, and develop an app that listens and responds to messages from a Slack workspace.
</div>

### Create an app
First thing's first: before you start developing with Bolt, you'll want to [create a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps/new). 

> ðŸ’¡ We recommend using a workspace where you won't disrupt real work getting done â€” [you can create a new one for free](https://slack.com/get-started#create).

After you fill out an app name (_you can change it later_) and pick a workspace to install it to, hit the `Create App` button and you'll land on your app's **Basic Information** page.

This page contains an overview of your app in addition to important credentials you'll need later, like the `Signing Secret` under the **App Credentials** header. 

<!--TODO - Update image to match the latest App Directory sidebar (but remove the Workflows beta) -->

Look around, add an app icon and description, and then let's start configuring your app ðŸ”©
