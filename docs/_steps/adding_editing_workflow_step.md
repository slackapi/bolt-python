When a builder adds (or later edits) your step in their workflow, your app will receive a [`workflow_step_edit` event](https://api.slack.com/reference/workflows/workflow_step_edit). The `edit` callback in your `WorkflowStep` configuration will be run when this event is received.

Whether a builder is adding or editing a step, you need to send them a [workflow step configuration modal](https://api.slack.com/reference/workflows/configuration-view). This modal is where step-specific settings are chosen, and it has more restrictions than typical modals—most notably, it cannot include `title​`, `submit​`, or `close`​ properties. By default, the configuration modal's `callback_id` will be the same as the workflow step.

Within the `edit` callback, the `configure()` utility can be used to easily open your step's configuration modal by passing in the view's blocks with the corresponding `blocks` argument. To disable saving the configuration before certain conditions are met, you can also pass in `submit_disabled` with a value of `True`.

To learn more about opening configuration modals, [read the documentation](https://api.slack.com/workflows/steps#handle_config_view).
