<a href="https://api.slack.com/block-kit/surfaces/modals">Modals</a> are focused surfaces that allow you to collect user data and display dynamic information. You can open a modal by passing a valid `trigger_id` and a <a href="https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/views">view payload</a> to the built-in client's <a href="https://api.slack.com/methods/views.open">`views.open`</a> method.

Your app receives `trigger_id`s in payloads sent to your Request URL that are triggered by user invocations, like a shortcut, button press, or interaction with a select menu.

Read more about modal composition in the <a href="https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals/using#composing_views">API documentation</a>.
